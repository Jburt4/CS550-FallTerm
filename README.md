# CS550-FallTerm
Text Game- My first bg project was a text game that I called Castle Adventure. I think it was a good idea, but it needed a little fie tuning because you had to wait through all the text again after you died.

SubSim1- It was my final project of the fall term that I worked on with Henry. Here, we incorporated things that we learned throughout the fall like 2-D arrays and class systems.

Dinosaur Class- This is class that I designed for owning a dinosaur. You can play fetch and try to ride the dinosaur, while making sure that it eats, drinks, and rests.

Mandlebrot Set- This was a project that we worked on a lot in class and it prints three pictures of mandlebrot set. It prints three different parts in three different colors.

Challenge Problem- This was a problem that we made in class where you couldn't let two numbers in accending order be next to each other. The trick was to append all of the evens to the end of the list.

Bank Account- This was more work with the class system that I thoght was interesting. You can withdraw, deposit, and open and close accounts.
